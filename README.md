# A modest portfolio made using React

***

This app uses conditional rendering and declarative component routing to deliver a tongue-in-cheek "about" component, a portfolio component featuring transparent-background PNG images of code snippets from a few of my projects which are also links to their GitHub repositories, a linked resume, and a simple footer component offering my LinkedIn, GitHub, and Email. 

Thanks for looking. (👍 ͡❛ ͜ʖ ͡❛)👍
